In\n            planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing\n            numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them\n            aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed.\n            By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive\n            bias of anchoring, where the first number spoken aloud sets a\n            precedent for subsequent estimates.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Check out more at{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker\">\n              https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker\n            </a>\n            .\n          </p>\n          <hr />\n          <p>\n            <a href=\"/projects/planning_poker/privacy_policy\">Privacy Policy</a>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <a href=\"/projects/planning_poker/terms_and_conditions\">\n              Terms & Conditions\n            </a>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport const planning_poker_privacy_policy: IStandardPageProps = {\n  title: \"Planning Poker Online: Privacy Policy\",\n  content: (\n    <div>\n      <p>\n        Alessio Bianchetti built the Planning Poker (SCRUM) app as a Free app.\n        This SERVICE is provided by Alessio Bianchetti at no cost and is\n        intended for use as is.

It’s your\n        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We\n        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which\n        is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed\n        by the official operating system of your device. It could make your\n        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your\n        phone’s security features and it could mean that the Planning Poker\n        (SCRUM) app won’t work properly or at all.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        You should be aware that there are certain things that Alessio\n        Bianchetti will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the\n        app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The\n        connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider,\n        but Alessio Bianchetti cannot take responsibility for the app not\n        working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you\n        don’t have any of your data allowance left.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should\n        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network\n        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your\n        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection\n        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,\n        you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming\n        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.\n        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the\n        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware\n        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for\n        using the app.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Along the same lines, Alessio Bianchetti cannot always take\n        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure\n        that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t\n        turn it on to avail the Service, Alessio Bianchetti cannot accept\n        responsibility.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        With respect to Alessio Bianchetti’s responsibility for your use of the\n        app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that\n        although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all\n        times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that\n        we can make it available to you. Alessio Bianchetti accepts no liability\n        for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying\n        wholly on this functionality of the app.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently\n        available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for\n        any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app\n        to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to\n        keep using the app. Alessio Bianchetti does not promise that it will\n        always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with\n        the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device.\n        However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when\n        offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may\n        terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to\n        you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights\n        and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop\n        using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2>\n      <p>\n        I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time.
